The game is a take on a turn based strategy game, featuring 4 different factions with unique units corresponding to the faction's theme. The player's victory condition will be conquering your enemies "Headquarters" (Denoted by 4 turns spent in a radii around the headquarters). Units are created around the headquarters by using the game's main resource, gold. Gold can be generated throughout the game by claiming "Gold generation" buildings. While other buildings can allow the player access to advance/different types of units relating to their faction.
